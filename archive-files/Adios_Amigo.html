          <p>
  To be honest my last archive was one of my weakest works. I dare say it was actually not even funny. I failed to make that part of my life abstract and to be blunt reading it sounds like just anyone begging for a better grade. With this I have decided to put my poker studies on halt and start studying comedy as Conan O’ Brien suggested. Holy shit I also realize that by the time this is posted I have been spelling his name as Conan O’ Brian and I will be fixing that.
