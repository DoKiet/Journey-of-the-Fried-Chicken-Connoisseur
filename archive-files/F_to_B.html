          <p>
          “Jesus Christ” was a common phrase used when my Biology professor looked at my quizzes. As the last day arrived in class and certainty an 
F was to be shown on my transcript I was able to pull out every excuse in the book convincing my professor not to fail me. After a D was guaranteed I pushed 
further. Turning an F to a B (He was retiring and didn’t want to deal with me anymore). Yes, Biology is Pseudoscience. 
Yes I was called a dumbass cause I raised my hand and said the reproductive organ of a female is a vagina.
