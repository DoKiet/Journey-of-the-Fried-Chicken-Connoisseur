          <p>
  A disclaimer to begin this story: Biology is in fact a pseudoscience. If you were to point a  gun to my head and had me tell you  a time when I used osmosis I would suggest just take the fucking shot. “Jesus Christ” and “Stay after class” were common phrases used by my professor when I handed him my quiz. I remember he held me hostage after class for a 30 minute private lecture about how the female reproductive organ is not the vagina but its the uterus. Well first off 2025 males can have uterus as well. An F was to be expected but I did what any self respecting connoisseur would do: rallied 7 other people who were failing as well. On the last day of class we made him stay behind and gave him a lecture speaking about the emotional trauma we had during this class and since we were buttering him up we would have taken him for another semester . We knew he was retiring and just wanted to leave so we had to stall till he got rid of us. At the end He gave me a B not because I deserve it but he told me
