          <h4>Artist's Statement</h4>
          <p>
          There's this deli owned by racist Ukrainians who would spew racail slurs and threaten kids near Susan E. Wagner High School, every student would visit
            after school to get a (BEC) sandwich. 
            Freshman year, on the entrance, there was, hm, how do I put it softly here... a group of douchebags always sitting outside.
            On this specific day, my wallet was loaded, and the douches caught a glimpse of the wealth I held. 
            That's when Connosieur used his move "Charm" (famously known as gaying his way out),
            which appalled the attackers. Noticing he's outnumbered 6 to 1, he makes a swift escape to the bus stop. 
            Fun fact: the dude mastered "charm" when dancing to Ariana Grande's "Break Free" in 3rd Grade.
