          <h4>Artist's Statement</h4>
          <p>
            There's this deli owned by racist Ukrainians who would spew racial slurs and threaten kids near Susan E. Wagner High School. 
            Every student would visit after school to get a (BEC) sandwich. 
            Freshman year, at the entrance, there was, hmm, how do I put it softly here... a group of douchebags sitting outside. 
            On this specific day, my wallet was loaded, and the douches caught a glimpse of the wealth I possessed. 
            "Give me some beans," they said as more of them started to surround me at the entrance, blocking my escape. 
            Cornered, the Connoisseur had no choice but to use "Charm" (famously known as gaying his way out), which appalled the attackers. 
            Noticing a small gap and outnumbered 6 to 1, he made a swift escape to the bus stop. 
            Fun fact: the dude learned "charm" when dancing to Ariana Grande's "Break Free" in 3rd Grade.
