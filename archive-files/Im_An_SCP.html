          <h4>Artist's Statement</h4>
          <p>
           7th grade when nobody wanted to play with me during lunch break. 
            I remember vividly telling one of my buddies that my grandfather was an O-5 (board level executive) who adopted me, which I, 
            the adopted, was an actual Keter (frequently breaks out) class who escaped and was planning on destroying the whole organization.
            Tomorrow Seth told me, "Kevin, I wish I could just get rid of the government and do this all myself." 
            The picture above shows an accurate representation of how I felt convincing him I was an SCP. 
            Pulled the same bullshit in 5th grade when I told a black kid I was a robot created by my uncle.
