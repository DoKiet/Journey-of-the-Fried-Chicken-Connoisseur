          <h4>Artist's Statement</h4>
          <p>
          Senior year of high school, I decided to make a funny diss track for my Government teacher, Mrs. Errichiello. No, I did not hate her; 
            she was one of the best. 
            I'm pretty sure there's a clip somewhere out there of me begging her not to suspend me after I did the one chip challenge in her classroom. 
            I also explained to her all my cheating exploits on tests so she could patch it.
            After that year, I heard she got a lot stricter on her students. 
            Also, I might put her on my ops list since she ratted me out when I was cheating on this driving test.
