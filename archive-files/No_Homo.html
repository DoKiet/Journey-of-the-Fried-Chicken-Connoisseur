          <h4>Artist's Statement</h4>
          <p>
         “I think you should take a professional ethics class,” my coworker told me — just because I mentioned my plan to adopt a fake gay persona to count cards at casinos.
          </p>
             <p>
      For the record, I have taken two ethics classes. I read The Ethicist every week I'll have her know! I was the Student Service Commissioner. My supervisor? Director of the LGBTQ center. I have gay friends. Hell, I’m practically gay by osmosis. I’m literally closer to being gay than she’ll ever be!
             </p>
          <p>
            Here's the official list of people most educated on the lgbtq community at work:
          </p>
          <p>
            -Actual gay people
          </p>
          <p>
            -Me
          </p>
          <p>
            So how dare she come for me like that? I’m literally practicing my high-pitched voice in the mirror just to perfect my character. I can’t wait for my sister’s makeup lesson. Don't hit me with that nile river crap.
