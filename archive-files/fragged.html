          <p>
            After experiencing a bomb of a rejection, one might question why Juice Wrld is featured. 
            To find out, we must go back to when I spotted Jennie holding hands with another individual on their way back to school. 
            After witnessing such a catastrophic scene, I equipped my ears with AirPods and played "All Girls Are The Same".

          </p>
          <p>- I will cut you down, break you apart, splay the gore of your profane form across the STARS! 
            I will grind you down until the very SPARKS CRY FOR MERCY! My hands shall RELISH ENDING YOU... HERE! AND! NOW! - Gabriel (UltraKill) </p>
