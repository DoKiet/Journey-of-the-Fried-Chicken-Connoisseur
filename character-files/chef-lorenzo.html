          <h4>
            "The Fried Chicken Connoisseur is a regular at Lorenzo's restaurant. He visits to talk to the chef about things that can only be revealed to family members or a complete stranger.
            Even so, the chef hates the connoisseur as he finds him nit-picky, and to the connoisseur, the chef could never quite hit the mark on his recipes. 
            They would nag each other, but in a good way; sometimes, it's good to have someone who knows and is equally as bad as you. 
            Lorenzo has great ambitions to earn his third Michelin star and always aims to reach perfection within his craft."
