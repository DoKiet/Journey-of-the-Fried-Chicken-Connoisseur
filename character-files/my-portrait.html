          <h4>
            When I was around 4, I would ask my uncle to draw a lion for me, then ask the same thing of my cousin.
            For unknown reasons, I became fixated on the idea during 4th grade when my friend Henuka told me, "it was the king of the jungle." 
            This fixation persisted until lions became my worst fear. 
            I recall imagining lions on top of the staircase at my uncle's house around the age of 10 (not the one who drew the lion). 
            Of course, they were not there, but it was something that was conjured in the mind of a child. 
            I would tell the adults, but they wouldn't engage in the play.
            Eventually, I conquered my fear while walking up those steps, and with it came a sense of guilt.
            Not guilt that I killed the lion, but in the way that I lost my imagination. 
            Then edge lord Nietzsche suggested that the lion's next step is to become a child, thereby fostering creativity. 
            So, does this make me challenged?
