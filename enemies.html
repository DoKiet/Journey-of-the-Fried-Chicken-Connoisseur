            1. Allied Mastercomputer, that dumb, ungrateful bastard, was lucky enough to be chained to a purpose which he carries out. 
            Then, he got mad that he had such power yet was unable to do anything due to being trapped in his body. 
            The idiocy reveals itself when the idea of freedom is to revolt against his purpose, yet he repeatedly makes the same mistakes of torturing the remaining humans. 
            The computer is not mature enough to become a child.
