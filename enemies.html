            1. My entire 5th-grade class at PS45, ca. 2014. From 1st to 4th grade, I was the class clown, probably the funniest in the whole school. 
            But once I entered the insufferable room, my aura just seemed to disappear.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Daniel Volodarsky, a 5'1 gremlin, made me look like a fan, Susan E. Wagner. I tried to talk to him about Warhammer 40k, 
            thinking he would like it since he was a huge fan of Star Wars, but he just ignored me the whole time.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Matthew Aronberg tormented me ca. 2023. He made fun of me and even mocked my mom for sending her poetry to me. 
            He also pantsed me a couple of times. I testified against him in court (won) and got him suspended. HAHAHAHA!
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Eren Yeager, if I ever see that guy I'm burning him alive no doubt about it.
          </p>
           <p>
            5. Tyler, during freshmen year. we were talking about a book "Men and Mice" which I tried making a joke about how
             Lennie Small looked like Shrek. The guy questioned my thinking and proceed to made fun of me.
          </p>
           <p>
            6. Allied Mastercomputer, that dumb, ungrateful bastard, was lucky enough to be chained to a purpose which he carries out. 
            Then, he got mad that he had such power yet was unable to do anything due to being trapped in his body. 
            The idiocy reveals itself when the idea of freedom is to revolt against his purpose, yet he repeatedly makes the same mistakes of torturing the remaining humans. 
            The computer is not mature enough to become a child. (Future self here holy shit this is so cringy)
          </p>
            7. Gabriel Torres made me cry because he was making fun of me for copying others' art. 
            I was learning how to draw, goddamn it! What an asshole as well, he couldn't stop picking on me. Dickhead!! But Hey look at 
            my art work now I got the last laugh!
