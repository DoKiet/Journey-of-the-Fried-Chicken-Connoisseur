            1.  Dick Cheney, former U.S. Vice-President. Gave me a smug "fuck
            you" wave and a tight little smirk of triumph when his motorcade
            passed the protest at his inaugural parade. Also, single-handedly
            dragged the country into an unprovoked war for oil. General
            all-around dick.

            2. Daniel Volodarsky, a 5'1 gremlin, made me look like a fan, Susan E. Wagner 2023. I tried to talk to him about Warhammer 40k, 
            thinking he would like it since he was a huge fan of Star Wars, but he just ignored me the whole time.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            3. Matthew Aronberg tormented me at Susan E. Wagner around 2023. He made fun of me and even mocked my mom for sending her poetry to me. 
            He also pantsed me a couple of times. I testified against him in court (won) and got him suspended. HAHAHAHA!

          <h4>
            4. Boredom is currently being a huge asshole, all because I'm spending more time with consciousness
              . Starting to figure out that I don't want to sit at the same lunch table as him.

          <h4>
            5. Allied Mastercomputer, that dumb, ungrateful bastard, was lucky enough to be chained to a purpose which he carries out. 
            Then, he got mad that he had such power yet was unable to do anything due to being trapped in his body. 
            The idiocy reveals itself when the idea of freedom is to revolt against his purpose, yet he repeatedly makes the same mistakes of torturing the remaining humans. 
            The computer is not mature enough to become a child.
