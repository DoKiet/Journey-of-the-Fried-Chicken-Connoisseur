This website was created on a whim as an attempt to rant about boredom. 
          Boredom has been a close friend of mine, but recently,
          he has become too much to bear. 
          My conscience has irritated him. 
          I wish to apologize but playing adult in a childlike dimension has refrain me from doing so.</h3>

           Originally, I had this whole box filled with just the word yap. After a long time now and revisiting my website, I realized how incredibly cringy I am. Of course, I still plan to keep all original works up since I believe that cringey makes it worthwhile. But holy shit, what was I thinking?

                Conan O'Brien is one of if not the best late night talk show host.
                I still laugh my ass off watching his interviews. 
                He had a HUGE HUGE HUGE contribution towards my humor and was a great person to watch if you wanted to learn how to just talk with a stranger. 
                Just to add, if I ever see that son of a bitch Jay Leno, don't worry Conan, I'll make sure the print of his teeth can be seen on a curb. 
                An addition I would like to make: George Lopez is shit and always will be; his best and only joke is "I'm a Latino."

            Found him when I was sitting in my English class, and my professor provided me with sources to construct my argument essay.
                Among the sources was "A Busy Trap," which I found hilarious. 
                Later on, I checked out his comic "The Pain -- When Will It End," great stuff, by the way. 
                Now I'm currently collecting his books. To show my support, 
                I celebrate the month of February, not because of various holidays like Valentine's, 
                but because that's the month when FedEx bought out Kinko's Copies (got rid of his early 2000s comics).
