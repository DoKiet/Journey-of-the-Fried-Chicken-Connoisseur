        <h1>Arknights#1 - Updated June 2025</h1>

        <p>
          A friend of mine recently laughed at me for saying Arknights is the greatest gacha game of all time. Then they laughed even harder when I said the second-best is Limbus Company. (I will not be going over Limbus Company. That is not today’s war.) Arknights is not just a good game, but a legitimate contender for one of the greatest mobile games in human history.

          Before we dive in, let’s establish some credibility. I am not new to this. I am an avid gacha game player. I’ve played Arknights since launch. I’ve played every gacha you’ve ever heard of: Fate, Epic Seven, Granblue, Honkai, Dragon Collection, Brave Frontier, Azur Lane, and all the Hoyoverse games. I believe myself to be a gacha scholar so this essay is only for the audience that is sophisticated in gacha games.

          Now, typically the counterarguments go after the body paragraph, but I see the uncanny ability to foresee every brain-dead rebuttal, so now's the best time to address them:
        </p>

        <p>
          “You just like it because the story speaks to you.”<br>
          Wrong. I don’t play games for stories. I play League of Legends and Blackjack. My brain is hardwired for mechanics, not lore.
        </p>

        <p>
          “You’re biased because you’ve played it since launch.”<br>
          Also wrong. I’ve played most gacha games since launch. Longevity doesn’t equal bias — it means I’ve stayed because it’s good, not out of sunk cost. Great. Now that those worries are out of the way, let’s talk about gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>
          Arknights is a tower defense game. Most levels strike that: not too easy yet not frustratingly hard. 95% of stages are thoughtfully challenging. The other 5% feel like you’re playing Baldur’s Gate on tactician mode during a fever dream. It also has an auto-deploy feature for farming after you beat a level, a blessing that shows the devs respect your time. And yes, the game is beatable with free units. No gacha gatekeeping. Plus, the pity system is heaven sent. They hate money.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s talk about art. Specifically: dragon girls. Nian’s design is a masterclass. The red and white color scheme practically screams "East Asian dragon royalty." She looks like someone who'd cause an interdimensional incident just to see what happens and her personality matches that perfectly. Dusk? Beautiful. I regret not getting her. Mostima? Mysterious, a little awkward, emotionally layered. Her black and blue aesthetic tells a story all on its own (I wish they added more to her lore). And Ling? Light blue and white with a drinking gourd — you usually would think this character would be yellow or green, but I don’t mind what they went for. Also I like how she has hair in a ponytail, the same for Nian. I prefer girls with long hair. Yes, I’m saving for the next dragon. No, it’s not a girl this time.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may think I'm exaggerating, but Arknights deserves this level of praise. It's polished, rewarding, stylish, and remarkably fair for a gacha game. If you still disagree, that’s fine — not everyone was born with taste. Anyway, I hope you’ve been educated. May you never again laugh when greatness is mentioned in your presence.
