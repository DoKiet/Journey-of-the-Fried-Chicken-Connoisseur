        <h1>Forgive Me, Father - June 2025</h1>

        <p>
          Disclaimer: This was written by me when Christain Farrah had a picture of me with my bare ass out. He sent it to an ROTC group chat demanding that I write an essay so he would delete it. This is not done in a mean spirit. Of course, it was all fun and games.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh, Father, Forgive me for my sins. My clenched cheeks have been exposed to the world's eyes. The tenderness of such flesh has been set to its highest standard, and tenderness at its finest. Oh, holy father, I have sinned, but my ass does look plumped up, so please forgive me.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main reason one should forgive me is my holiness. One day, I was on a trip to the holy Capital, Washington D.C. I slept with Abed, and as the sun arose, greeting me with its motherly warmth, I woke up. Slowly yet surely, I opened my eyes to see YOU WORK, MY FATHER, YOUR HOLY BIBLE, sitting next to me, ready to be touched by my sinister hands. O the cleansing, the cleaning of such souls. I thank you wholeheartedly, my father.
        </p>

        <p>
          As stated by the introduction, my ass is bared for the world to see, but the issue is I have devoted myself only to god. So I can't have my ass be seen by my ROTC members. I understand that we are a team and we share with one another, but I can't share my body, for it is only for god. As my ass is a product of god, it shall be served on his last supper for god.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see, I have only sinned once in my life, and that was a time when I saw the most handsome man on the planet. His name was Christian Farrah. He has a beaming smile, is very cute, and is indeed armed with an amazing fragrance that has shot me in my oh-so-passionate heart. For such a man, what can I do? For I am willing to suck his toes in order for him to reserve my ass for god and god only.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you see, my holy father, we are your products, and we are flawed. We tend to make mistakes, but as you intended, we are here to help one another. Of course, since you intended such benevolence for the human race, Christian Farrah will delete the photo, and the world shan't be traumatized by my baring ass once more.
