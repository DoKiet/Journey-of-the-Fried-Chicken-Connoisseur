        <h1>I Love New York - Updated June 2025</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
          I once rode the Boston subway. Big mistake. Red Sox fans barked ‘‘Fuck New York’’. That was the moment I realized—New York doesn’t
need to scream. It already won.”. On that day the Red Socks and the Yankees were having a match. C.C. where are you going with this you might ask.
Let me get to that point. New York transit may be dirty, but at least it’s not filled with clam chowder lovers.
They repeated that ratchet statement multiple times making a disturbance till they finally got off.
          </p>

          <p>
If you are going to learn anything from reading this you must learn that New York is the best city in the world here's why.
          </p>

          <p>
           
As you know, Chipotle is one of the most expensive fast-food chains. In New York. Ordering my bowl would cost $17 to $19. That's an atrocity.
That's why we have things like Quactime I bet no other states have Quactime it offers bowls double the size triple with 
Chipotle's recent shrinkflation (I’m not kidding) and at a cheaper price. 
Now the trick to get more bang for your buck is to always ask for a little more and make sure you don't say extra cause they’ll charge you. 
          </p>

          <p>
         Now I’m not a huge fan myself but I know that he’s growing in popularity so I must add it here as a bonus. 
New York has a nightclub named the Knitting Factory. Why is this important? It's where Nettspend held his first-ever concert.
How do I know? I was there. Besides me getting hanged cause I said” I don't know who he is.’’ It was a great experience and some of them need deodorant.
          </p>

          <p>
      Are you a fan of horror? I bet you are! 
I know very few people that do but since you're reading this you already saw the horror show that this website is.
Now I want you to name me what's the piece of horror fiction on there? 3…2….1 EERIE PUBLICATION!! 
Everyone loves eerie publications I bet you didn't know they come from New York now you have another reason to add to the New York #1 bucket list.
</p>
   <p>
     Now name two of the best things that ever happened that right I heard are Jean-Michel Basquiat and the New York Times. 
You don't need to pay 500 dollars to see art!! You just need to walk down the street also THE BOSTON GLOBE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE PRINT! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
</p>
 <p>
    And also you can visit celebrities without charge like Radioman, Supreme Mama, Dapper Dan, I can go on and on with the list. 
Like, name me a city where you can have hundreds of people watching you eat a rotisserie chicken. Plus let's discuss the Criterion Closet! 
Nowhere else in the world has that EXCEPT NEW YORK!!! If you look hard enough, trust me there's something for you within this state be it the high peaks of Catskills,
the quiet streets of Staten Island, or the bustling place that is the city.
</p>
 <p>
  
You don’t need a map. You don’t need a ticket. You just need a bodega, BEC, shoes with mileage, and a stomach that can handle halal at 3 a.m. 
Welcome to New York. We’re the most technologically advanced landfill in the world.
