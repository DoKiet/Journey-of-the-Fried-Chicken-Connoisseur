        <h1>Chicken Connoisseur Verse - Updated June 2025</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
           I had a fascinating talk with my co-worker recently, and, well, initially, I didn't think
 this was worth noting down yet, but I am. I will be introducing the most powerful being in the C.C verse
 At the very top is Ginatam; nothing can beat this classic. I collected the whole manga series. My phone background
 is Gintama, and I have a lighter holder inspired by Gintama. I believe I'm the biggest Gintama fan writing this down
 I should buy a wooden katana to honor the Gintama verse.

          </p>

          <p>
           The second is Conan O Brien. As you can tell from the front page, it has contributed a lot to making this website
 He also taught me a lot about comedy and how to become a nice person, even though it can be very tough at times.
 I never understood why my friend cried when Juice Wrld Died or when One Direction Split apart, but thinking of 
 The inevitable end to Conan's life made me tear up a bit. I don't think we will get another Conan O'Brien in 
 One hundred years, I don't think we can get another ever. That man is the only ginger that has a soul. You see his influence
 in my humor and self-deprecation.

          </p>

          <p>
           
 If Gintama was the Earth and Conan O' Brien was Heaven, then The Ethicist of the New York Times 
 written by Kwame Anthony Appiah would by the light. You can see its clear influence on my writing style. I seek to 
 write about mundane things and make them lively and interesting. Also, it taught me so much about how to handle
 social situations and was a great read when bored. I hate reading books. They take too long to get to the point, but The 
 Ethics is a great read that teaches the same lesson and gives you the same situation as you can find in books.

            I found Tim Kreider in my college writing class. Where he wrote that it was a flex to not have to work. Yes 
 you might be saying, but Kevin, that's common sense. NOT BACK THEN, everyone was saying things like I have a job and shit
 acting all important. BEING UNEMPLOYED HAS ITS OWN PERKS!! Kreider was truly ahead of his time, and he introduced me to
 Caricatures, since I have always wanted to be able to draw political cartoons.
          </p>

          <p>
      Norm Wattenberg,Don Schlesinger,Stanford Wong. I put these three in the same rank since they were the ones that 
 introduced and helped me learn card counting, which is a great hobby of mine. As if writing this right now, I am 20
 I cannot hit up any casinos near me yet, but once I turn 21, trust me, I'm gonna be hitting the casinos every single
 week.
